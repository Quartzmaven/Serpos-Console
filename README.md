# What is Serpo's Console?
Serpo's Console seeks to maintain the idea of QC: "What if Legacy Console Edition never discontinued?"
We try to incorporate new features from modern Minecraft whilst retaining the best of LCE. We do this via a variety of mods.

Such as Legacy4J which near-perfectly recreates the LCE Menu and HUD,
And other mods to recreate Legacy as if it never ended.
