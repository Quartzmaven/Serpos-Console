# What is Serpo's Console?
Serpo's Console seeks to maintain the idea of Quartz's Console; "What if Legacy Console Edition never discontinued?"
We try to incorporate new features from modern Minecraft whilst retaining the best of LCE. We do this via a variety of mods.

Such as Legacy4J which near-perfectly recreates the LCE Menu and HUD,
And other mods to recreate Legacy as if it never ended.

As such Quartz's Console is, this modpack is required on both Client and Server to run properly.

# Why use this over Quartz's Console?
Here's a list of reasons to use this over QC;
- Massively better performance and less mod conflictions
